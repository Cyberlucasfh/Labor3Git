        <article class="divider"> Have you ever said any of these sentences? No, for real. If you haven't, stop reading this website right now. Good, now that we are rid of those lame folks: We are going to solve all these problems by strapping technology to your hands. And you WILL like it.
        Developed by only the best anime-addled engineers in Northern Germany, the future is looking up. No more lists, no more messing up, just future. All day and all night. Future future future. Maybe one day our glove will write example texts for websites autonomously. We are working on it. You can watch youtube at work. Never really focus again.
        Our glove is an expert for SEO. The glove can take care of your children. Self driving cars? Boring. The glove is going to drive you to work. Annoying partner? Just marry the glove. It is programmed for 100% commitment. 100% of the time! </article>
        <article class="divider">You can order one right now. I need money for more electronics parts. How do I make the html items on the side fill up this mainbody element. I need to research that. Be right back.  </article>
    <article class="divider">Nice, it worked. Anyways, Makerglove will touch you in places you never even knew existed! Your body, interfaced, with the matrix. Let robots suck out your lifeforce or whatever that movie was about. I don't know, I have got no time to rewatch "The Matrix" since I am doing websites all day. </article>
